    "\n",
    "In this section, we set up the foundation for our content-based movie recommender using weighted matrix and kmeans clustering to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted movies. Our system takes in a list of movies and their respective ratings and then recommends movies that are similar in genres to the liked movies. . The higher the ratings of the movies, the more impact their genres will have on the recommended movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Method used</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many methods can be used to build a content-based recommender system. Usually, content-based recommender suggests movies of similar style to the inputted movies. What makes our recommender special is that it allows the user to input their ratings along with their movies, allowing for more flexibility and customization. For example, when using Netflix, their recommender has no way of recommending movies as they have no knowledge of the watch history of the specific user. In our case, the user can enter movies with their specific ratings, and their recommended movies will be specific to the genres and adjusted depending on the ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the ratings to have an impact on the recommendation system, we decided to use a weighted matrix due. By using a weighted matrix, we can multiply the ratings of the users by the genres related to the inputted movies, allowing the matrix to represent a specific taste of the user. The total scores of each genres for each movies can then be summed together, and the highest score represents the best recommendations. By doing so, genres of high rated movies will have more impact than other less significant genres, allowing the ratings to impact the recommendations in a significant manner. "

    "<h4>Step 4: Data Modeling</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "For our data modeling, we are using movies weight matrix to find similar movies to recommend. The method takes in a dataframe movies which represents the dataset, a list of movies taken from the user, a list of ratings taken from the user, and the number of recommendation the user would like. The input movie list and rating list corresponds to the rating for each movie the user has listed. For instance, suppose moviesInput = [movie1, movie2, movie3] and inputRatings = [1,8,9], then the user rates movie1 a rating of 1, movie2 a rating of 8, and movie3 a rating of 9. This means that the user likes movie2 and movie3, and dislikes movie1. \n",
    "\n",
    "From these inputs, we create a matrix using the moviesInput and inputRatings. We can also collect distinct genres that for our movies dataset. Then, we create a matrix using the movie dataset and add columns for distinct genres. For each movie, a value of 1 is assigned to genre columns that the movie has and a value of 0 otherwise. For instance, if movie1 is a Family, Animation, and Comedy movie, a value of 1 will be given under Family, Animation and Comedy columns, and other genres will have a value of 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to multiply these matrices to obtain a matrix that has the weight of the users' ratings. This weighted movie matrix is obtained by multiplying the previous matrices. Then, we normalize each genre to obtain a general factor which represents the user profile. The highest normalized value represents the genre that the user prefers. We also ignore movies from the input list since, the goal of a recommender is to give movie suggestion that are not part of the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we multiply the user profile matrix with our dataset to obtain a new weighted movies matrix which will be used to find the movies that the user will like. We sum all genre rows into a value and the highest score will be the movie that the recommender recommends to the user. The higher the score, the more likely the user will enjoy the movie since the recommend movies ressembles the liked input movies that the user rated. Finally, we return the number of recommendations the user wanted based on a decreasing order of the sum column. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the generalized steps used for our data modeling:\n",
    "1. Create a matrix using input user ratings\n",
    "2. Collect distinct genres \n",
    "3. Create a matrix using movies from the data preparation `movies_df`\n",
    "    - Create a column for each genres\n",
    "    - For each row, we add a value of 1 if the movie is part of the genre otherwise the value is 0\n",
    "4. Multiply input user ratings matrix (step 1) with movies matrix (step 3) and obtain the weighted genre matrix\n",
    "5. Aggregate the weighted genres and normalize them to create a user profile to know which genres the user likes \n",
    "6. Mutiply the normalized user profile with the candidate movies to obtain a weighted movies matrix\n",
    "7. Sum all columns to get a score for each movie\n",
    "8. Recommended movies with the highest score"

    "<h4>Recap of Content-Based recommender system</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "The content-based recommender system is a recommendation system that suggests items based on the similarity of the item's features to the user's preferences. In our case, we made our recommender in a way so that it would be able to include the user's ratings over the movies which are inputted into the system, allowing for more flexibility and customization over their recommendations. Our recommender system then recommends movies based on genres similarity, and puts more emphasis over those with a higher rating based on the input of the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "A downside of our recommender system is that it is limited to recommending items that are similar to the inputted movies, and may not be able to recommend items which does not have the same genre scope. An alternative to that would be collaborative, where we match user's preference to other similar types of user ratings. Furthermore, since our database of movie is sparse, some movies have a large number of genre attached to it while others only have one genre. Due to the fact that we use a weighted matrix, this can greatly affect the accuracy of our recommender system since movies with multiple genres have more chance to be recommended, as the total sum is impacted by their multiple genres. A minor solution can be to give a very high rating to movies which are liked, as it would impact their sum in a way which makes the multiple genres less significant, or to put movies which are very disliked a rating of 0, which will nullify the impact of their multiple ratings as they will have a value of 0."
