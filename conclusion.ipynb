    "Overall the project represented an invaluable learning experience. We were able to start with a proof by manipulating a dataset based on the slides and our model evolved as we progressed to larger sets first developing a cosine similarity based item-item model and finally using latent factors. Interestingly for our data set the item-item cosine similarity model performed the best with regards to our evaluations and our data set in question. \n",
